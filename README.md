# 🤖 ADB & Fastboot Installer++ v2.0.0

---
#### Informations
Tired of another situation where the installer URL doesn't work, the hosting has stopped working, or simply the file expired - and to find the right one, you have to dig through a ton of malware and viruses. I decided to provide an open-source, very simple version of the system-wide `Android ADB and Fastboot Installer++ v2.0.0`.

#### Updated API and Drivers
**Android ADB and Fastboot Installer++ v2.0.0**: is the only installer with updated the installer files to the **latest Android SDK/NDK** and **Android API 33 / R13**.
